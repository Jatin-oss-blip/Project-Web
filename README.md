# Project-Web
In this dry run, we'll pretend to open this Visual Studio solution file and see what happens:

**1. File format and compatibility:**

* Weを確認 (kakunin - verify) the format version (12.00) which suggests compatibility with Visual Studio 2013 or later.
* We 確認 the Visual Studio version used (17.11) which likely corresponds to Visual Studio 2022.  
* We check the **MinimumVisualStudioVersion** (10.0.40219.1) - any version of Visual Studio from 2010 onwards should be able to open this solution file.

**2. Project recognition:**

* We identify a project named "Pongg" with a specific file path (Pongg\Pongg.csproj) and a unique identifier. 
* Based on the project type identifier "{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}", we might recognize it as a C# project.

**3. Configuration settings:**

* We parse the **Global Sections**.
    * **SolutionConfigurationPlatforms:** We see two build configurations defined: Debug and Release, both targeting "Any CPU" (meaning the project can run on any processor architecture).
    * **ProjectConfigurationPlatforms:** We see these configurations assigned to the "Pongg" project. Each configuration likely has specific build settings associated with it (e.g., optimization level for Release).
    * **SolutionProperties:** We see a setting to **not** hide the solution node in the project explorer.
    * **ExtensibilityGlobals:** This section might contain additional solution-specific settings, but for a dry run, we wouldn't process them in detail.

**Overall:**

Based on this information, if we had Visual Studio 2022 (or a compatible version) available, we could open this solution file and see the "Pongg" project with its build configurations. We wouldn't be able to actually build or run the project without the project files themselves (like Pongg.csproj and its associated source code files).
 
**Note:** This is a simplified dry run, and a real Visual Studio might perform additional actions during the opening process.
